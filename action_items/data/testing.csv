"It's a sad reality that everything comes to an end and that we're not given an exact explanation of why we're here or what the meaning of it all is. The way I see it is that we're here to give our life meaning one way or another. Since we don't know the meaning we have to make the meaning. Some people find that through their work, family, helping others, etc. Life is full of endless possibilities of what we can do with it. It's hard getting to the point where we feel like we're happy or accomplished but that in itself is another aspect of life and finding meaning. For some people it could take most of their lives to find the meaning that they were looking for and in my view I'd rather spend my whole life looking for that meaning and helping who I can along the way than to just accept that there's no meaning to it and end it since that's not really an answer. I may never get the answer myself but I can at least enjoy the journey leading to the end and maybe that in and of itself was the meaning all along. You'll meet many varieties of people throughout your life who will give you different perspectives of what meaning is to them and maybe that will help you on your journey and maybe it won't. We have the time we're given and what we do with it is dependent on us.
